# NVIDIA_Stock_Price_Forecasting

This project navigates through the process of modelling and forecasting NVIDIA stock prices based on historical data from the S&P 500 dataset. We start by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) where we have an idea about the data and clean it in a way that will serve our models. Then, we perform test statistics to test whether the data is stationary or not, follwed by data normalization. We start with simple models whose residuals are tested for autocorrelation, we move on until we detect a good model to use for forecasting. At the end, performance is compared.
